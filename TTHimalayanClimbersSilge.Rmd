Goal: Build a model to predict the probability of an expedition member dying or surviving, based on the person's and expedition's characteristics.  What can we learn?

Loading libraries
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(tidytuesdayR)
library(scales)
library(ggthemes)
#install.packages("skimr")
library(skimr)
```

Loading datasets.
```{r}
tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load('2020-09-22')

members <- tuesdata$members
```

Initial exploration.
```{r}
skimr::skim(members)

#Notice we are missing a lot of data for for $age.  We'll use TidyModels to inpute this missing data (can just filter when columns are only missing a little bit of data). Also notice that we are trying to predict deaths, which are rare in our dataset (~1.5%).  We need to consider this when building our model.
```


```{r}
members %>%
  group_by(year = 10 * (year %/% 10)) %>%  #Essentially grouping by decade, here.
  summarise(died = mean(died),
            success = mean(success)) %>%
  pivot_longer(died:success, names_to = "outcome",
               values_to = "percent") %>%
  ggplot(aes(year, percent, color = outcome)) +
  geom_line(alpha = 0.7 , size = 1.5) +
  theme_fivethirtyeight() + 
  labs(x = "",
       y = "",
       color = "Outcome",
       title = "Outcomes of every expeditions into the Himalayas") +
  theme(axis.title = element_text(),
        text = element_text(family = "Times New Roman")) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = percent)


members %>%
  group_by(age = 10 * (age %/% 10)) %>%  #Essentially grouping by decade, here.
  summarise(died = mean(died),
            success = mean(success)) %>%
  pivot_longer(died:success, names_to = "outcome",
               values_to = "percent") %>%
  ggplot(aes(age, percent, color = outcome)) +
  geom_line(alpha = 0.7 , size = 1.5) +
  theme_fivethirtyeight() + 
  labs(x = "Age",
       y = "",
       color = "Outcome",
       title = "Outcomes of every expeditions into the Himalayas") +
  theme(axis.title = element_text(),
        text = element_text(family = "Times New Roman")) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = percent)
```



```{r}
members %>%
  count(success, died) #Notice that it's possible to die and have the expedition succeed.

members %>%
  count(success, died) %>%
  group_by(success) %>%
  mutate(percent = n/sum(n)) #Notice more people died in the failed expeditions than the successful ones.
```


```{r}
members %>%
  count(peak_name, sort = TRUE)

members %>%
  filter(!is.na(peak_name)) %>%
  mutate(peak_name = fct_lump(peak_name, prop = 0.05)) %>%
  count(peak_name, died)


members %>%
  filter(!is.na(peak_name)) %>%
  mutate(peak_name = fct_lump(peak_name, prop = 0.05)) %>%
  count(peak_name, died) %>%
  group_by(peak_name) %>%
  mutate(percent = n/sum(n)) #Notice how how "Other" is!
```


```{r}
members %>%
  filter(season != "Unknown") %>%
  count(season, died)

members %>%
  filter(season != "Unknown") %>%
  count(season, died) %>%
  group_by(season) %>%
  mutate(percent = n/sum(n))

members %>%
  filter(season != "Unknown") %>%
  count(season, died) %>%
  group_by(season) %>%
  mutate(percent = n / sum(n),
         died = case_when(died ~ "Died",
                          TRUE ~ "Did not die")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(season, percent, fill = season)) +
  geom_col(show.legend = FALSE, position = "dodge", alpha = 0.8) +
  facet_wrap(~died, scales = "free")
